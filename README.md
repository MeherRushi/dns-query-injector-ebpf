# DNS Query Delay Injector

## **Objective**
The goal of this assignment is to build a tool that can **introduce delays** in DNS query packets. These delays can be **user-defined** or **random**. The tool should provide filtering capabilities based on:
- **The container or process** making the DNS request
- **The target URL** being queried
- **The DNS server** handling the request

---

## **Repository Setup**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd dns-delay-injector
   ```
2. **Modify and extend the provided template** according to the requirements.
3. Also upload a screen recording of the tool running on your system.

---

## **Implementation Details**
- Use **eBPF** to intercept and manipulate DNS packets at the kernel level.
- Introduce configurable delays based on:
  - Process/container metadata
  - Specific DNS queries or domains
  - Specific DNS servers
- Implement a **user-space control program** using **libbpf, BCC, or Go eBPF**.
- Ensure the program allows users to specify delay times dynamically.
- Provide logging for debugging and verification.

---

## **Documentation Requirements**
Your submission must include:
- A **README.md** file with:
  - Clear setup and installation instructions
  - Usage examples and command-line arguments
  - Required dependencies and supported versions
- Well-documented code with meaningful comments.
- A script (`scripts/test.sh`) to test the delay functionality.


## Judgment Criteria

- The submission will be judged based on how well the architecture of the eBPF program is built and how optimised it is. We will first check for the prescense of all the functionalities followed by documentation and coding standards.

## **Submission Instructions**
1. Complete your implementation and ensure it meets the assignment requirements.
2. Update the `README.md` with detailed instructions on how to build and run your solution.
3. **Make a pull request (PR)** to submit your final code.
4. Your PR should include:
   - A description of your implementation.
